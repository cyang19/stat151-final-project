\textbf{What was the impact of COVID on depression in China? Was that most caused by stringency, public health, or economic downturn?}

# Data

# Methods

Our data have time (month), $t$, nested in an individual $i$ who belongs to a family $f$ in a community $c$ that is in one of China's provinces $p$. 

Our stringency metric, $\text{Treat}_{pt}$, ranges from 0 to 24 (TO BE UPDATED) and is 0 for all months in surveys taken before 2020. For the 2020 and 2022 surveys, the stringency metric varies across provinces and across months. Our multilevel model is:

\begin{align*}
\text{Level 1 (time within person):} \\
y_{tifcp} &= \pi_{ifcp} + \beta_{1}\,\text{Treat}_{pt} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{Z}^{\top}\mathbf{Z}_{tifcp} + \varepsilon_{tifcp}, \\
\varepsilon_{tifcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\varepsilon), 
\end{align*}

where $y_{tifcp}$ is the depression score for individual $i$ in family $f$, community $c$, province $p$ at month $t$, $\text{Treat}_{pt}$ is the province-by-month COVID policy stringency index, and $\mathbf{Z}_{tifcp}$ is a vector of time-varying, individual-level covariates (e.g.,LIST SOME HERE age, income, whatever; see Appendix Table A1 DO THE APPENDIX). The coefficient $\beta_{1}$ captures the average association between policy stringency and depression, conditional on other covariates.

\begin{align*}
\text{Level 2 (person):} \\
\pi_{ifcp} &= \beta_{fcp} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{X}^{\top}\mathbf{X}_{ifcp} + u_{ifcp}, \\
u_{ifcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_i),
\end{align*}

where $\mathbf{X}_{ifcp}$ is a vector of time-invariant individual-level covariates (e.g., LIST SOME HERE see Appendix Table A1) and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{X}$ is the corresponding coefficient vector. The random intercept $u_{ifcp}$ captures unobserved, person-specific heterogeneity.

\begin{align*}
\text{Level 3 (family):} \\
\beta_{fcp} &= \gamma_{cp} + u_{fcp}, \\
u_{fcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_f),
\end{align*}

where $u_{fcp}$ is a family-level random intercept.

\begin{align*}
\text{Level 4 (community):} \\
\gamma_{cp} &= \alpha_{p} + u_{cp}, \\
u_{cp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_c),
\end{align*}

where $u_{cp}$ is a community-level random intercept.

\begin{align*}
\text{Level 5 (province):} \\
\alpha_{p} &= \nu + u_{p}, \\
u_{p} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_p),
\end{align*}

where $\nu$ is the grand mean depression level and $u_{p}$ is a province-level random intercept.

Taken together, this specification allows us to estimate the province-month stringency effect $\beta_{1}$ on individual depression while accounting for time-varying individual covariates, time-invariant person-level covariates, and clustering of observations within persons, families, communities, and provinces.
