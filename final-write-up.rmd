# Intro

In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Chinese government instated a "Zero-COVID Policy," one that emphasized heavy regulation of personal freedoms with the goal of limiting COVID cases to zero. Much has been said about China's policy-making during this time, including expository journalism[^1], research[^2], and public protest.[^3] Existing literature on China's repsonse to COVID-19 has largely emphasized typical epidemiological effects including COVID-19 prevalence, respiratory outcomes, and more. We identified a gap of longitudinal studies that seek to interrogate how COVID-19 impacted the mental health of Chinese citizens during this time. 

\noindent As such, we are primarily interested in the following two research questions:

- What was the impact of COVID on depression in China?
- Was that most caused by stringency, public health, or economic downturn?

# Data

We combine data from a number of sources. Our foundational data is taken from the \href{https://cfpsdata.pku.edu.cn/#/home}{China Family Panel Survey (CFPS)} out of Peking University. We use its survey waves in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022; we only use those individuals who were surveyed at each of these timepoints and were not missing crucial covariates or outcomes ($n=12806$). Our outcome is given by the CES-D 20 survey, a questionnaire that asks questions about a respondents mental health and produces an output on a 60 point scale. The CFPS collected data on this during each of these waves.

We merge this data with three different continuous treatment variables. First, is the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) which provides data on the stringency of government regulations during COVID. It's data was collected by [BLANK]. Second, are public health indices from the Open COVID Data Portal—specifically, we use BLANK METRIC. Lastly, we use BLANK FOR ECONOMICS.

Our data has five levels: 4 time points nested in 12806 individuals in 7770 families in 3318 communities in 32 provinces. 

# Methods

Our data have time (month), $t$, nested in an individual $i$ who belongs to a family $f$ in a community $c$ that is in one of China's provinces $p$. 

Our stringency metric, $\text{Treat}_{pt}$, ranges from 0 to 24 (TO BE UPDATED) and is 0 for all months in surveys taken before 2020. For the 2020 and 2022 surveys, the stringency metric varies across provinces and across months. Our multilevel model is:
\begin{align*}
\text{Level 1 (time within person):    }
y_{tifcp} &= \pi_{ifcp} + \beta_{1}\,\text{Treat}_{pt} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{Z}^{\top}\mathbf{Z}_{tifcp} + \varepsilon_{tifcp}, \\
\varepsilon_{tifcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\varepsilon)\\
\text{Level 2 (person):    }
\pi_{ifcp} &= \beta_{fcp} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{X}^{\top}\mathbf{X}_{ifcp} + u_{ifcp}, \\
u_{ifcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_i)\\
\text{Level 3 (family):    }
\beta_{fcp} &= \gamma_{cp} + u_{fcp}, \\
u_{fcp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_f)\\
\text{Level 4 (community):     }
\gamma_{cp} &= \alpha_{p} + u_{cp}, \\
u_{cp} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_c),\\
\text{Level 5 (province):    }
\alpha_{p} &= \nu + u_{p}, \\
u_{p} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_p),
\end{align*}
where $y_{tifcp}$ is the depression score for individual $i$ in family $f$, community $c$, province $p$ at month $t$, $\text{Treat}_{pt}$ is the province-by-month COVID policy stringency index, and $\mathbf{Z}_{tifcp}$ is a vector of time-varying, individual-level covariates (e.g.,LIST SOME HERE age, income, whatever; see Appendix Table A1 DO THE APPENDIX). The coefficient $\beta_{1}$ captures the average association between policy stringency and depression, conditional on other covariates.

where $\mathbf{X}_{ifcp}$ is a vector of time-invariant individual-level covariates (e.g., LIST SOME HERE see Appendix Table A1) and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{X}$ is the corresponding coefficient vector. The random intercept $u_{ifcp}$ captures unobserved, person-specific heterogeneity. We also include $u_{fcp}$ as a family-level random intercept, $u_{cp}$ as a community-level random intercept, and $u_{p}$ as a province-level random intercept. $\nu$ is the grand mean depression level.

Taken together, this specification allows us to estimate the province-month stringency effect $\beta_{1}$ on individual depression while accounting for time-varying individual covariates, time-invariant person-level covariates, and clustering of observations within persons, families, communities, and provinces.
